                            <h2><b>community values</b></h2>
                            <h3>welcoming differences</h3>
                            <p>Here you are free to be as "normal" (or "abnormal") as you want to be. Perhaps growing up you felt out of place somehow -- odds are you'll still stick out here, but that's encouraged :)</p>
                            <p>In particular, if you're queer or questioning, know that Senior Haus is a safe, accepting place where you can feel comfortable being yourself. We have a large queer community, and we're proud of it.</p>

                            <h3>taking care of each other</h3>
                            <p>The small number of residents and the long history of the haus have made it very much like one big, happy, dysfunctional family. As you can imagine, this big happy family often has problems and we aren't all friends with one another, but on the whole you will find that this is one of the most social and friendly dorms on campus.</p>
                            <p>And like a family, we take care of each other when things get tough, which happens for everyone at some point during their four years here. <b>If you ever feel alone or need help/advice, you can always go to a member of the house team or a hall chair</b> (see the <a href="government.html" style="text-decoration: underline">haus government page</a>).</p>

                            <h3>individual freedom and communal responsibility</h3>
                            <p>Senior Haus is a place for you to explore your identity and have new experiences, but it's also a community that works hard to be healthy and happy. Don't expect to get away with actions that endanger yourself or others. A crucial part of personal agency is personal accountability.</p>
