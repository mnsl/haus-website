                                    <p>There are three types of things that Heads of House, Associate Heads of House, and GRTs (abbreviated to HoH/GRT below) are <b>required</b> to report <b>outside of Senior House</b>:
                                    <ol>

                                    <p>If an item is not on this list, a HOH/GRT is not required to report anything outside of 
                                    Senior House. In situations where outside reporting is not required, 
                                    the HoH/GRT may opt to share information with the non-undergrad members of
                                    the house team. Whenever possible, the HoH/GRT will ask students for permission
                                    and/or inform students of the intention to share more broadly
                                    before information is shared. This usually happens in cases where
                                    there is a concern for student wellbeing, but reporting outside of Senior
                                    House is not currently required. In these cases,
                                    HoH/GRTs make their best effort to not include information students
                                    request to be kept private whenever possible. If a student has
                                    particular information they want to share that they'd like to keep
                                    confidential (and is not covered by mandatory reporting requirements), that student
                                    can request such from the HoH/GRT.

                                    <h3>1. Sexual harassment/violence</h3>
                                    <p>HoH/GRTs must inform the Title IX Office of instances
                                    of sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, stalking, and
                                    sexual assault that they learn of in which 
                                    one of their residents is involved (as
                                    alleged perpetrator or survivor) and in cases 
                                    where they learn of relevant instances in their role as
                                    HoH/GRT.</p>
                                    <p>HoH/GRTs are not obligated to inform the Title IX Office of harassment/violence
                                    that occurred when a survivor was 
                                    not enrolled
                                    at MIT. When
                                    a HoH/GRT contacts
                                    a 
                                    Title IX coordinator (usually
                                    Sarah Rankin), they share information they know about the
                                    situation, and together brainstorm the appropriate next steps. HoH/GRTs
                                    will consult with and keep survivors updated throughout this
                                    process. After speaking with a HoH/GRT, the Title IX
                                    coordinator will usually reach
                                    out to the survivor to offer support and gather information, but
                                    may hold off and/or wait for additional information if that would
                                    be in the interest of student safety. Survivors will be able to
                                    decide the next steps they are comfortable with (such as formal
                                    complaints or accommodations), except in (rare) circumstances of
                                    significant concern for the safety of the broader MIT
                                    community, in which case an investigation may need to be conducted.</p>

                                    HoH/GRTs must report cases where there

                                    of one of their residents. This includes acute cases where harm is
                                    imminent or has already occurred. Scenarios include alcohol and
                                    drug overdoses, accidents/severe injuries requiring emergency

                                    situation, the HoH/GRT may contact the
